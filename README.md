### Hi there 👋

My name is Tianyi Shi. I am an undergraduate student studying biochemistry at University of Oxford.

<!-- - 🔭 I’m currently working on parsing PDB files in Rust with nom. -->
- 👨‍💻 I'm an intermediate programmer in Javascript, Python and R. [My most popular poject](https://github.com/TianyiShi2001/rmarkdown-vscode) was an VS Code extension written in TypeScript for better R Markdown file editing experience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning proper bioinformatics by myself, in addition to biochemistry which is my major. I'm [implementing classic algorithms in different programming languages](https://github.com/TianyiShi2001/bioinformatics-algorithms) (namely Javascript, Python and Rust). I'm learning Rust as my first step towards low-level programming. Rust has [near-C performance](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/q6600/which-programs-are-fastest.html) while being much better documented and designed (for its safety, centralised package registry, automated and standardised documentation generation, and so on), which fascinated me.
