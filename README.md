### Hi there 👋

My name is Tianyi Shi. I am an undergraduate student studying biochemistry at University of Oxford.

<!-- - 🔭 I’m currently working on parsing PDB files in Rust with nom. -->
- 👨‍💻 I code in Rust, Javascript, Python and R. [My most popular poject](https://github.com/TianyiShi2001/rmarkdown-vscode) was an VS Code extension written in TypeScript for better R Markdown file editing experience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning proper bioinformatics by myself, in addition to biochemistry which is my major. I'm learning Rust as my first step towards low-level programming. Rust has [near-C performance](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/q6600/which-programs-are-fastest.html) while being much better documented and designed (for its safety, centralised package registry, automated and standardised documentation generation, and so on), which fascinated me.
- 🧬 I'm actively contributing to [**rust-bio**](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio).
- 🦀 I'm recently lauching an ambitious project, [**rust-bio-edu**](https://github.com/TianyiShi2001/rust-bio-edu), which aims to implement as much as possible algorithms in Rust and explaining them to people. I hope this project will help those who want to learn bioinformatics to realize that, proper, fast, production-ready bioinformatics algorithms doesn't need to be implemented in C/C++. I will show that the simplicity and elegance of Rust has made low-level programming required by bioinformatics much more approachable to biologists. **I'm looking for collaborators on this project.**
